**New York City Airbnb Data**

Airbnb, Inc is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. Based in San Francisco, California, the platform is accessible via website and mobile app. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; instead, it profits by receiving commission from each booking. The company was founded in 2008. Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com.

**Context**

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in New York City [Kaggle:Airbnb](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata/data)

**Dataset**

The following Airbnb activity is included in this New York dataset:

Listings, including full descriptions and average review score Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

## **Steps**

### Step 1 - Explore the dataset

```{r}
# install and packages and libraries needed

#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("ggplot")
#install.packages("dplyr") 
#install.packages("gtExtras")
#install.packages("leaflet")


```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr) 
library(gt)
library(gtExtras)
library(stringr)
library(leaflet)
```

```{r}
# Read the dataset
data <- read.csv("Airbnb_Open_Data.csv")

#View(data) # gives the view of entire dataset
```

```{r}
head(data) # first 6 rows 

#tail(data) # last 6 rows
```

```{r}
dim(data) # shape - 102599, 26
```

```{r}
names(data) # names of all the columns
```

```{r}
#str(data) # to check the datatype

glimpse(data) # better than str to see the data
```

```{r}
sum(duplicated(data)) # there are 541 duplicate values
```

Insights -

With the glimpse we can see all the datatypes for the columns.

We can see that price, service fee have character dataype rather than int and last review is also character instead of date

### STEP 2 - DATA CLEANING

```{r}
# next lets drop our dupliacted rows

data <- data %>% 
  distinct() 

dim(data) # 102058 , 26
```

```{r}
# next, lets deal with our null / misisng values
names(data)
```

```{r}
# lets look at the missing values - 
# lets convert all blank rows to NA

data <- data %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~na_if(., ""))) 
#View(data)

data %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "Column", values_to = "Missing Values") %>%
  gt() %>% # neaten the table
  tab_header(title = "Missing Values Across the Dataset") %>%
  cols_align(align = 'left') %>%
  gt_theme_dark()
```

Insights -

The number of missing data differs across the dataset with missing values in 23 columns

We cannot directly remove these, we will perform data manipulation on this

The license column is almost empty. There are 102597 rows are missing, hence this isnt a column that would be useful for us.

There are just 2 rows. We can see what they are, but they are of no use, so lets drop

```{r}
data %>%
  filter(!is.na(license)) %>%
  select(license) 

# drop column license- 
data <- data %>% 
  select(-license)

#View(data)
```

```{r}
# next lets look at the house rules column, there are 51842, almost half missing values
# these rules dont account to any specific need. We can check an individual rule, but its not important for our purpose, so we will drop
data <- data %>% 
  select(-house_rules)
```

Insights -

For remaining columns, let do the cleaning based on the questions we are planning to answer

Data cleaning is based on your problem statement. Whether to drop or do imputation differs according to the question.

For this dataset we will will tackle rest missing values based on the following problems

### STEP 3 - DATA MANIPULATION

```{r}
# first lets start with dealing with our datatype conversion

data <-data %>% 
  mutate(price = as.numeric(str_remove(price, "\\$"))) %>% 
  mutate(service.fee = as.numeric(str_remove(service.fee, "\\$"))) %>% 
  mutate(last.review = as.Date(last.review, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))
#View(data)

```

### STEP 4 - DATA DESCRIBE AND SUMMARY

```{r}

# lets check the summary for our numeric data columns
data %>% 
  select(price, service.fee, minimum.nights, number.of.reviews,
         review.rate.number, reviews.per.month,
         calculated.host.listings.count, availability.365) %>% 
  summary()

## this summary is useful for us to look at the distribution of the dataset
# minimum nights, number of reviews, review rate number and review rate month and calulated.host.listing.count, doesnt have any spread. 
```

### STEP 5 - DATA VISUALIZATION - QUESTIONS

I have solved around 12 questions on this dataset, you can find this project on my [Github](https://github.com/Siddhi1529/Airbnb-R.git)
